# Structural Pattern
### Structural php/src patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

# Types

- ### [Adapter Pattern](../../../../main/php/src/Structural/Adapter)

converts the interface of one object so that another object can understand it.

- ### [Bridge Pattern](../../../../main/php/src/Structural/Bridge)

Bridge is a structural php/src pattern that lets you split a large
class or a set of closely related classes into two separate
hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be
developed independently of each other.

- ### [Composite Pattern](../../../../main/php/src/Structural/Composite)

this pattern is used when we want to represent a hierarchy and we want to treat the object of the hierarchy the same way;

- ### [Decorator Pattern](../../../../main/php/src/Structural/Decorator)

Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a
flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

- ### [Facade Pattern](../../../../main/php/src/Structural/Facade)

Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a
higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

- ### [Flyweight Pattern](../../../../main/php/src/Structural/Flyweight)

Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.

- ### [Proxy Pattern](../../../../main/php/src/Structural/Proxy)

Proxy is a structural php/src pattern that lets you provide a
substitute or placeholder for another object.
